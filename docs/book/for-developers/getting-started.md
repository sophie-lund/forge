# Getting started

You'll need to install these dependencies on your system to get started:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) (only for editing this book)

Run this command to run the automated tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

And to serve a development version of the book, run:

```bash
cd docs
mkdocs serve
```
